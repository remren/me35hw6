# ME35: Project 1 (hw6)
Group Members: Douglas, Maria, and Remy
## Purpose
Create an arm which can deliver "body parts" into a particular game _(which may or may not be called Opera-)_.

This will require CAD for the design and creation of the arm. MicroPython will be used to handle the logic that drives
the Pico W controlling the arm motors.

A combination of PyQt and Python will be used to create a GUI / dashboard which will display info about the arm and
various control options.
